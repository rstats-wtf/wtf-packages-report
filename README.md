# wtf-packages-report

Get started via

```r
usethis::use_course("rstats-wtf/wtf-packages-report")
```

* Have a look around the files here. Where are the R scripts? What are the directories `data` and `figs` for? Do the names and structure help you find things?
* Open each R script, finish it, and run it. Remember to restart R as you go, so you are certain each file is complete, i.e. data flows through explicit write/read, not the global workspace.
  - `R/01_write-installed-packages.R`
  - `R/02_wrangle-packages.R`
  - `R/03_barchart-packages-built.R`
* It's OK if you don't finish! We can keep working on this later.
* If you finish quickly, write an R script to run the whole analysis and, perhaps, another script that does a `make clean` style reset.
